# Admin Features Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This audit identified and fixed critical issues in the Next.js + Supabase admin features. The main problems were:

1. **Authentication Mismatch**: API routes were using NextAuth instead of Supabase Auth
2. **Missing Restaurant Resolution**: No proper way to get current user's restaurant
3. **Missing RLS Policies**: Database policies needed for proper access control
4. **Incomplete Error Handling**: Missing cases for users without restaurants

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Settings Page: "Failed to load restaurant data"

**Root Cause**: API route was using NextAuth session instead of Supabase Auth, and had no way to resolve the current user's restaurant.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/admin/restaurant/route.ts` (backup: `.bak.20241220_143000`)
- `src/app/admin/settings/page.tsx` (backup: `.bak.20241220_143000`)

**Fixes Applied**:
- Created `lib/admin-utils.ts` with `getCurrentUserRestaurant()` helper
- Updated API route to use Supabase Auth with proper session handling
- Added proper error handling for users without restaurants
- Added CTA to create restaurant when none exists

### 2. Categories: "Unauthorized" when adding

**Root Cause**: Same authentication issue as settings page.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/admin/categories/route.ts` (backup: `.bak.20241220_143000`)

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated to use Supabase Auth instead of NextAuth
- Uses `getCurrentUserRestaurant()` to get restaurant context
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access

### 3. Products: Can't add because categories fail

**Root Cause**: Same authentication issue, plus missing category validation.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/admin/products/route.ts` (backup: `.bak.20241220_143000`)

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated to use Supabase Auth instead of NextAuth
- Uses `getCurrentUserRestaurant()` to get restaurant context
- Added validation to ensure category belongs to user's restaurant
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access

### 4. "Menu" Admin Section Analysis

**Current State**: The menu admin section (`src/app/admin/menu/page.tsx`) is a placeholder with hardcoded data.

**What it currently does**:
- Shows static categories (Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts, Beverages)
- Displays hardcoded menu items with random item counts
- Has non-functional "Add New Menu Item" and "Manage" buttons
- No actual database integration

**Recommendation**: This section should be removed or replaced with proper functionality that integrates with the existing Categories and Products pages.

## Database Schema Analysis

**Tables Used**:
- `restaurants`: Stores restaurant information
- `categories`: Stores menu categories (linked to restaurants)
- `products`: Stores menu items (linked to categories and restaurants)
- `user_restaurants`: Links users to restaurants with roles
- `users`: Public user profiles (separate from auth.users)

**Key Relationships**:
- `user_restaurants.user_id` → `users.id`
- `user_restaurants.restaurant_id` → `restaurants.id`
- `categories.restaurant_id` → `restaurants.id`
- `products.restaurant_id` → `restaurants.id`
- `products.category_id` → `categories.id`

## RLS Policies Required

Created `scripts/admin-rls-policies.sql` with comprehensive policies:

**Restaurant Policies**:
- SELECT: Restaurant owners can view their restaurants
- UPDATE: Restaurant owners can update their restaurants

**Category Policies**:
- SELECT: Restaurant owners can view their categories
- INSERT: Restaurant owners can create categories for their restaurants
- UPDATE: Restaurant owners can update their categories
- DELETE: Restaurant owners can delete their categories

**Product Policies**:
- SELECT: Restaurant owners can view their products
- INSERT: Restaurant owners can create products for their restaurants
- UPDATE: Restaurant owners can update their products
- DELETE: Restaurant owners can delete their products

**User Restaurant Policies**:
- SELECT: Users can view their restaurant relationships

## Files Created

1. `lib/admin-utils.ts` - Helper functions for admin operations
2. `scripts/admin-rls-policies.sql` - Database policies for admin access
3. `docs/admin-audit-report.md` - This audit report

## Files Modified with Backups

1. `src/app/api/admin/restaurant/route.ts`
2. `src/app/api/admin/categories/route.ts`
3. `src/app/api/admin/products/route.ts`
4. `src/app/admin/settings/page.tsx`

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Run RLS Policies**: Execute `scripts/admin-rls-policies.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Test Settings Page**: Verify restaurant data loads and updates work
3. **Test Categories**: Create, edit, and delete categories
4. **Test Products**: Create products with categories
5. **Test No Restaurant Case**: Verify CTA appears for users without restaurants

## Security Considerations

- All admin operations now properly verify restaurant ownership
- RLS policies ensure database-level security
- API routes use server-side Supabase client with proper session handling
- No client-side secrets exposed

## Performance Notes

- Uses efficient joins through `user_restaurants` table
- Proper indexing on foreign keys recommended
- Single query to get restaurant with ownership verification

## Next Steps

1. Execute the RLS policies SQL script
2. Test all admin functionality end-to-end
3. Consider removing or implementing the Menu admin section
4. Add comprehensive error logging for production
5. Consider adding audit trails for admin actions
